In India, fire safety standards are not strictly implemented. This concept was inspired by a fire that almost killed 22 pupils at a coaching centre in Surat. We created an IoT-based fire safety alert. In the event of a fire, one can gain access to the hardware component, which is a device positions next to the fire extinguisher that will activate the building's alarm. Either the gadget consisting of a button that must be pressed three times or the flame should make contact with the sensor, triggering the alarm, which will cut off the power in that certain area, switch on the red lights, and sound the siren that are battery operated. After the alarm is activated, a warning message and the location are communicated to the appropriate authorities(i.e fire station, hospital, department heads etc..) through a webpage. This initiative, which is a part of smart city management, avoids collateral damage in the event of a fire by reducing reaction time and providing timely assistance.
